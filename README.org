#+TITLE:METAKANREN

METAKANREN is a relational programming system operating on types in
the C++ template system.  The intent of METAKANREN is to provide a
proof-of-concept relational style of type deduction on top of the
existing functional type deduction to facilitate new styles of
template meta programming.


METAKANREN is based on μKanren [fn:Mermann2012], which is a minimal
functional core for relational programming.  The system is implemented
with a small set of list processing functionality to make the analogy
between μKanren and the core of the METAKANREN  system as strong as
possible.
